## Project Setup

A app specific secret key should be put into a .env file.  This secret key should be of the form EVENT_TRACKER_SECRET_TOKEN: your_secret_key . A key can be easily generated by running `rake secret` on the console.  See .env_example for an example file. If deploying this app in production, the key will need to be placed in the environment variables.

`git clone git@github.com:tuckerd/event_tracker.git`
`rake db:setup`
`rails s`
Go to browser and go to localhost:3000
